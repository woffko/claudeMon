# Agent Instructions

These instructions supplement the maintainer's global agent rules.

## Project

- ClaudeMon is a Rust TUI for Claude Code usage, session history, and limits,
  derived from CoMon (https://github.com/ssh4net/CoMon). The work plan is in `PLAN.md`.
- Use English only for repository content (code, comments, docs, commits).
- Keep repository text ASCII-only (inherited `scripts/check-ascii.sh`).
- Never commit real transcripts, prompts, session ids, or local paths; tests
  use synthetic fixtures only.
- Never read or persist Claude Code credentials except in the explicit
  opt-in OAuth limits mode described in `PLAN.md`.

## Long-running commands with Longrun MCP

- For a reviewed, trusted, non-interactive command expected to run longer than about 30 seconds, use `longrun.start_job` exactly once when it is available and the exact project root is enrolled.
- After a bridge-enabled `start_job` returns, never call `longrun.get_job`, `collaboration.wait_agent`, a generic wait tool, `write_stdin`, log-tail tools, or any polling loop in that turn. In the automatically resumed turn, call `longrun.get_job` exactly once and continue from the terminal result.
- Use `wake_policy="none"` only with ordinary `codex` or an explicitly requested manual fallback. In that mode automatic wakeup is unavailable: end the turn without waiting, and use one `longrun.get_job` only in a later user-resumed turn. If it is still running, end that turn without polling again.
- Treat `longrun.run_and_wait` as legacy compatibility mode because current Codex runtimes may convert a pending blocking call into model-driven wait cycles. Progress heartbeats are disabled by default and do not fix that outer wait loop.
- Never put secret values in command arguments, MCP fields, prompts, or environment. For one reviewed non-interactive command that accepts one finite secret stdin payload, prefer `project_memory_stage_test_asset_for_longrun` when a suitable encrypted test-only asset exists, then pass only its one-time `stdin_secret_id` to Longrun; do not ask the user to re-enter that stored credential. Use `codex-longrun-secret` only when no suitable asset is enrolled. Output is suppressed for secret-stdin jobs. TTY-dependent or repeated password prompts remain unsupported. Do not use longrun for interactive programs, daemons, or unreviewed commands.
- Keep project roots narrowly enrolled. Never broaden `LONGRUN_ALLOWED_ROOTS` to `$HOME`; add each trusted project root explicitly.
- The global MCP configuration is loaded by new Codex processes. After installing, upgrading, or changing longrun configuration, start a new process or resume the session from a new process.
- Whenever creating a project-level `AGENTS.md`, include this section unless that project explicitly opts out or already has stricter equivalent guidance.
